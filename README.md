# CamelCalculator
This was a programming task for a SPA, for which I chose AngularJS. I do not actually believe in the male attractiveness traits as depicted in the calculator, I am merely reflecting some common stereotypes. Bear in mind this is my first AngularJS app without training wheels on :)

Basic unit tests will be added. Although not the most complicated app, also want to try integrating Travis CI.
